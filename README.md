## Description
The provided script forms the backbone of an advanced Vehicle Color Detection System, made using Python, NumPy, and OpenCV.

Merging Python's computational logic with OpenCV's image processing capabilities allowed us to create a system not only precise in color detection but also responsive. This venture exemplifies the formidable potential of combining Python and OpenCV in crafting solutions that are not only efficient but also highly intuitive, marking a significant advancement in the realm of vehicle recognition technology.
