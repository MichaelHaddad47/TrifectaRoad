## Description
The provided script forms the backbone of an advanced Vehicle Color Detection System, made using Python, NumPy, and OpenCV.

Merging Python's computational logic with OpenCV's image processing capabilities allowed us to create a system not only precise in color detection but also responsive. This venture exemplifies the formidable potential of combining Python and OpenCV in crafting solutions that are not only efficient but also highly intuitive, marking a significant advancement in the realm of vehicle recognition technology.

### Installation
1. Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Numpy
- OpenCV-Python

2. Run below lines in your terminal:

First, check your Python version:
```bash
python --version
```
If Python is not installed, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).

Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd path/to/project/directory
```

Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install opencv-python
```
NOTE: Do the above in the environement created to prevent errors!

Run the car detection system:
```bash
python Car_Detection_System.py
```
